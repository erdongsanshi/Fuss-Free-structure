# The Effectiveness of a Simplified Structure for Crowd Counting

## ðŸŽ‰ Great News!

This work has been accepted by **IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (TIM)**!  

Official implementation of our paper:  **[The Effectiveness of a Simplified Structure for Crowd Counting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938701)**

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data Preparation

- Download crowd-counting datasets, e.g., [ShanghaiTech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pSXVqS9NxIKs8W4-DAH38StWiWvBv1Zh/view?usp=drive_link)
                                          [NWPU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mt9aEyejhsx3rCIaW2jepFQGacv5qFzw/view?usp=drive_link)

- You can also implement your own datasets processing according to the processing file

## Training
update root "data-dir" and "dataset" in ./train.py, Other parameters can be adjusted as required
```bash
python train.py
```
You can set ```--wandb 1``` in ```train.py``` after having logged in to wandb (```wandb login``` in console) to visualize the training process

## Testing
Due to the image clipping size is different during training, the clipping size should be adjusted accordingly during validation. The clipping size is 256Ã—256 for SHA, 512Ã—512 for SHB, and 384Ã—384 for NWPU.
```bash
python test_image_patch.py
```
